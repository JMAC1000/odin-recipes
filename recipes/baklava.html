        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Preheat the oben to 350 degres F(175 degrees C). Butter the bottom and <br>
                sides of a 9x13-in pan. 
            </li>
            <li>Chop nuts and toss with cinnamon. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Unroll phyllo dough. Cut whole stack in half to fit pan. Cover phyllo <br>
                with a dampened cloth to keep from drying out as you work. Place two <br>
                sheets of dough in pan, butter thoroughly with a pastry brush. Repeat <br>
                until you have 8 sheets layered.
            </li>
            <li>Sprinkle 2 to 3 tablespoons of nut mixture on top. Top with two sheets of <br>
                dough, melted butter, nuts, layering as you go. The top layer should be <br>
                about 6 to 8 sheets deep.
            </li>
            <li>Using a sharp knife cut into diamond or square shapes all the way to the <br>
                bottom of the pan. You may cut into 4 long rows then make diagonal <br>
                cuts. Bake for about 50 minutes until baklava is golden and crisp.
            </li>
            <li>Make sauce while baklava is baking. Boil sugar and water until sugar is<br>
                melted. Add vanilla and honey. Simmer for about 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Remove baklava from the oven and immediately spoon sauce over it. <br>
                Let cool.
            </li>
            <li>Serve in cupcake papers. This freezes well. Leave it uncovered as it gets <br>
                soggy if it is wrapped up.
            </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
