        <p>
            Avgolemono soup is celebrated for its uniquely velvety texture, achieved by<br>
            tempering eggs and lemon juice into hot broth. The eggs give the soup a silky, <br>
            creamy consistency without the need for cream, while the rice or orzo adds a <br>
            gentle thickness and soft, tender bites. This smooth, luscious base contrasts <br>
            beautifully with the occasional chunks of shredded chicken or vegetables, <br>
            making every spoonful satisfying yet light.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In terms of flavor, avgolemono strikes a delicate balance between tangy and<br>
            savory. The fresh, bright notes of lemon are the star, cutting through the <br>
            richness of the broth and creating a refreshing zing. This citrusy sharpness is<br>
            softened by the warm, comforting taste of chicken stock, which anchors the<br> 
            soup in familiar, hearty flavors. Together, the creamy texture and vibrant taste <br>
            make avgolemono both nourishing and invigorating, a dish that soothes and <br>
            uplifts in equal measure.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 lbs. chicken</li>
            <li>1/2 cup uncooked white rice</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>2 medium lemons, juiced</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            yields 6 servings
        </p>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse chicken and remove any organs that may be inside. Place in a pot large <br>
                enough for it to move around, but not too big or the broth will be watery. <br>
                Add the chicken neck if that is included with your chicken.
            </li>
            <li>Fill the pot with enough water to cover by about 1 inch. Cover and bring to a<br>
                boil. When it boils, reduce heat to low and simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour, <br>
                skimming the fat from the top as it collects. The meat should pull from the <br>
                bones easily.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer the chicken to a large bowl and set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Add rice to the broth and season with salt and pepper. Simmer over low heat <br>
                until rice is tender, about 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>While the rice is cooking, whisk eggs and lemon juice together in a bowl. <br>
                Remove chicken meat from the bones.
            </li>
            <li>When rice is finished, turn off the heat. Whisk one ladle full of hot broth <br>
                into the eggs slowly so the eggs do not curdle. Gradually whisk in more broth <br>
                until the egg mixture is heated. Pour the hot egg mixture back into the pot, <br>
                whisking briskly. The result should be a creamy, cloudy-looking soup. Season <br>
                with salt, pepper, or lemon juice as needed.
            </li>
            <li>Add pieces of chicken to the soup before serving or serve soup with salted <br>
                chicken on the side.
            </li>
        </ol>
