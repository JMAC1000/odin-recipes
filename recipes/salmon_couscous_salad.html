        <p>
            Salmon couscous salad offers a delightful medley of textures that keeps each <br>
            bite interesting. The couscous is light and fluffy, providing a tender base that<br>
            contrasts beautifully with the flaky, melt-in-your-mouth texture of cooked <br>
            salmon. Crisp vegetables like cucumber and bell peppers add a refreshing crunch, <br>
            while ngredients such as toasted nuts or seeds introduce a satisfying bite. If <br>
            crumbled feta or creamy avocado is included, they lend a rich, velvety element <br>
            that complements the salad’s overall lightness.
        </p>
        <p>
            The flavors of the salad are a perfect balance of richness and brightness. The <br>
            salmon brings a buttery, savory depth, enhanced by the aromatic spices or herbs <br>
            it may be seasoned with. This is offset by the zesty tang of a lemony dressing, <br>
            which ties all the ingredients together with its fresh, citrusy notes. Add-ins <br>
            like briny olives, sharp red onions, or sweet cherry tomatoes provide bursts of<br>
            flavor, ensuring every forkful is layered, vibrant, and satisfying.

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare Couscous: In a medium saucepan, bring 1 1/4 cups water, 1 Tbsp. olive<br>
                oil, and 1/4 tsp. salt to a boil. Stir in the couscous, cover with a lid, and <br>
                remove from heat. Let the couscous steam for 5 minutes. Use a fork to fluff <br>
                the couscous and break up any clumps. Transfer to a large bowl to slightly <br>
                cool.
            </li>
            <li>Cook Salmon: Pat salmon dry with a paper towel. Rub with 2 tsp. olive oil, <br>
                and season with za'atar spice and 1/2 tsp. salt. You can cook salmon one of <br>
                two ways: under the broiler or on the stovetop:<br>
                Broil Salmon: Preheat broiler with oven rack 6 inches from heat. Place fillet,<br>
                skin side down, on a foil-lined baking sheet. Broil to desired degree of <br>
                doneness, 8 to 10 minutes.<br>
                Sauté Salmon: Heat 1 to 2 Tbsp. of olive oil in a skillet over medium-high. <br>
                Place salmon, skin side-down, in pan and cook for about 3 minutes, until the <br>
                flesh turns from translucent to opaque all the way up the sides. Gently flip <br>
                salmon (usually a fish spatula, ideally), turn off heat, and cook for another 3 <br>
                to 4 minutes, or until fully cooked.Once the salmon is cooked, let rest for about <br>
                5 minutes before using a fork to flake into small pieces.
            </li>
            <li>Prepare Feta Dressing: In a medium bowl, combine olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon<br>
                mustard, honey, garlic, salt and pepper; whisk to combine. Stir in feta cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Assemble Salad: To the bowl with cooled couscous, add cucumber, parsley, dill,<br>
                and red onion; toss well. Add flaked salmon and dressing; gently stir to <br>
                combine. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Garnish with extra crumbled <br>
                feta and/or herbs, if desired.
            </li>
        </ol>
